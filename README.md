LUNAR SG (Super Glue) rocket design and documentation

This is the LUNAR SG (Super Glue) model rocket.  This rocket is designed to be an
inexpensive kit with parts made with a 3D printer that can be assembled and launched
within 30 minutes.  We use this at 
[LUNAR (Livermore Unit of the National Association of Rocketry)](http://www.lunar.org/)
launches for people who did not bring a rocket or who lost their rocket.  It flies reliably on
B and C motors.

We have an
[instruction sheet in docs](docs/SG Lunar Rocket Kit.pdf)
for assembling the rocket.  To put together a kit you need
the following:

# 3D Printed parts
* Fin can - [stls/LunarSGFinCan.stl](stls/LunarSGFinCan.stl)
* Fins - [stls/LunarSGFin.stl](stls/LunarSGFin.stl)
* Nose cone - [Ogive nose cone by dbsnyder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:345464) or use a pre-made BT-50 nose cone.  Needs to weight at least 80g for proper balance and flight.
* Retainer - [stls/LunarSGRetainerCap.stl](stls/LunarSGRetainerCap.stl)
* Launch lug - [stls/LunarSGLaunchLug.stl](stls/LunarSGLaunchLug.stl)

I recommend printing the fin can and nose cone in PETG or ABS.  PLA+ is fine for the fins.

# Other parts
* Parachute
* 18" BT-50 body tube
* Kevlar string
* Nomex square parachute protector
* Super glue (CA)

# Recommended tools
* Body tube marking aid - I use a piece of aluminum angle from Home Depot
* Pencil
* Sandpaper
* Scissors
* Hobby knife

Gloves are recommended for the assembler and also the coach when working with superglue!
